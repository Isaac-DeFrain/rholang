# Rholang Work To Do & Resources

## Priority
* Formal semantics in K (finish implementation started by Derek and Martin)
 - [rho-syntax.k](https://github.com/Isaac-DeFrain/krho/blob/Matching/rho-syntax.k)
 - [pattern-match.k](https://github.com/Isaac-DeFrain/krho/blob/Matching/pattern-match.k)
 - [Normalizer in Rholang](https://rchain.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CORE/pages/506331242/Rholang+interpreter+overview)

* Structural-behavioral type system for Rholang in K
 - Type system [GitHub](https://github.com/Isaac-DeFrain/rholang)
 - Pattern matching is type inclusion [is-in.k](https://github.com/Isaac-DeFrain/rholang/blob/master/is-in.k)


## Later

* Proofs of desirable properties
 - Which desirable properties?

* Write papers about formal semantics and desirable properties


## Greg re Rholang
 - Shortest path to a type system is namespace logic
 - Topological view: nested boxes with channels on boundary (variant of Milner's bigraphs)
   - algebraic approach is fundamental
 - Algorithm: program -> polytope


## Collaborate with Joshy

* Finish Rholang manual
* Finish Rholang tutorial
* Second interpreter in Haskell [current interpreter](https://rchain.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CORE/pages/506331242/Rholang+interpreter+overview)
* Rholang eductaion
